# FalakZoom-3D-Solar-System-Simulator
Developed for the INNOVATHON Hackathon

FalakZoom is an interactive 3D space exploration simulator designed with precision, performance, and multilingual accessibility in mind.

• Realistic Simulation: Accurately modeled planetary orbits, rotations, and speeds based on real astronomical data to create an immersive, educational experience.

• Custom Camera System: Engineered smooth and intuitive 3D camera controls in JavaScript, forming the foundation for dynamic space navigation.

• Optimized Architecture: Refactored the entire codebase to ensure minimal memory usage and optimal performance across browsers.

• Intuitive UI/UX: Integrated responsive UI elements, including a planet dropdown, interactive info boxes with “read more”/“close” functionality, and a sleek, user-friendly interface.

• Instant Bilingual Support: Implemented real-time language switching between Arabic and English with no reload required, enhancing accessibility for diverse users.

• Tech Stack: Built entirely using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

FalakZoom demonstrates strong skills in 3D development, performance optimization, and multilingual UI engineering.Developed for the INNOVATHON Hackathon FalakZoom is an interactive 3D space exploration simulator designed with precision, performance, and multilingual accessibility in mind. • Realistic Simulation: Accurately modeled planetary orbits, rotations, and speeds based on real astronomical data to create an immersive, educational experience. • Custom Camera System: Engineered smooth and intuitive 3D camera controls in JavaScript, forming the foundation for dynamic space navigation. • Optimized Architecture: Refactored the entire codebase to ensure minimal memory usage and optimal performance across browsers. • Intuitive UI/UX: Integrated responsive UI elements, including a planet dropdown, interactive info boxes with “read more”/“close” functionality, and a sleek, user-friendly interface. • Instant Bilingual Support: Implemented real-time language switching between Arabic and English with no reload required, enhancing accessibility for diverse users. • Tech Stack: Built entirely using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
